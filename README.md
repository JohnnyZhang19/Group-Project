File Responsibility: Ha Do UCID: 30097811

Game Description:
This is a classic snake game where players use 4 keys on the keyboard UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT to control the snake's movement. The ultimate goal of the game is too eat as much egg as possible, grow in length and level up, as well as trying to avoid hitting the bomb obstacles, the walls or the snake's body itself. Players can choose different level of difficulty before entering the game, and during the game, they can press the spacebar to pause and resume the game. The game's funky background music, sound effect and image visualisation will give you a new sense of relaxation, while still promoting high concentration and eye-hand coordination.
